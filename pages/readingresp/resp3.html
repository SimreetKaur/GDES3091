		<h2>READING RESPONSE #3</h2>

		<h1>Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h1>
<p>I agree with Laurel Schwulst to a certain extent – it is important for individuals to have websites over social media, depending on the intention of its use. If one is using social media for the solo purpose of sharing content to a networked community, I believe that it is not necessary to have a website because the content is posted simply to be shared, and not stored – the purpose is to connect with others through the means of a pre-created network, which leads to an outcome that is beyond sharing content; it becomes a means of building contacts and relationships. Simply put, it is a platform where multi-way communication is efficient, although social media platforms themselves are flawed (from a corporate perspective). On the other hand, if somebody’s intent is self-exposure and to bring attention to their own content, without the purpose of connecting with a network, it is appropriate to have an individual website. Regardless of the purpose or intent, individual websites have many more benefits than having social media profiles such as having full control over your website, privacy, the way your content appears, etc. Overall, depending on the intent and use of the website/social media profile, it is more appropriate for individuals to have their own websites than social media profiles.</p>
<h1>In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</h1>
<p>The behaviour of websites is similar to leaves on a tree, where the tree trunk is the internet and websites are the leaves. Although everything on the internet is not directly connected, one website leads to another, making it all interconnected. It is not necessary for websites to have actual links directing to other websites – if a user learns something from one website, and searches it further, leading the user to another website, the two websites become connected even though they are not directly connected.
