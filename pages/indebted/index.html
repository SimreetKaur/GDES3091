	  <h4> The Untold Story of Sikhs in Ontario </h4>
    <h5> Gurduara Sahibs, the Sikh place of worship, played a crucial role in the settlement of Sikhs in Ontario. In the Sikh religion, it is a tradition to seek blessings from the Guru (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Jee) before starting any venture.</h5>
  <div class = "bluebackground">
    <h6> Having a Gurduara Sahib close by is a necessity for every Sikh. During the period of mass immigration of Sikhs in the 1960s and 1970s, Gurduara Sahibs served as community centres for all South Asian communities because it was a safe place for minorities to practice their traditions and maintain their identities while living in a foreign country. This page shares the history of some of the earliest and most significant Gurduara Sahibs in Ontario's history. </h6>

        <h1>Shromani Sikh Society</h1>
        <h2>269 Pape Avenue, Toronto</h2>
        <p>Shromani Sikh Society, also know as “Pape Gurduara,” was the first Gurduara Sahib (Sikh place of worship) in the Greater Toronto Area. This milestone is crucial as it assisted in the development of Sikhs in the GTA. When this Gurduara was established, there were only 200 families from India in the area — so, this served as a community centre for all Indians, regardless of their religion.</p>

        <h1>Ottawa Sikh Society</h1>
        <h2>25 Gurdwara Road, Ottawa</h2>
        <p>The Ottawa Sikh Society was created in 1968 by four individuals named Jaspal Singh, Gurcharan Singh, Gurbachan Singh and Kuldip Singh. During the time of establishment, there were approximately twenty-five families in the area who met up for monthly divans, or congregations, at St. George’s Church, and later on at Memorial High School.This group also took the initiative to host an “All Canada Sikh Conference” at Carlton University, along with regular Gurmukhi classes. Sikh Youth Camps were also held occasionally. The Ottawa Sikh Society played a significant role in 1986, when Sikh refugees arrived at the dock of Nova Scotia. All the women who served in the ship were honored by the Society.</p>

        <h1>London Sikh Society</h1>
        <h2>37 Clarke Road, London</h2>
        <p>A group of seven Sikhs began this association in 1968, which soon after grew into a larger community — in 1971, their constitution was written. Venues, such as the Legion Memorial Hall, were rented for long periods of time to hold weekly divans.In 1980, 6.2 acres of land was purchased for $126 000 and a Gurduara Sahib was built. Upon the completion of construction in 1982, weekly Sunday divans and classes were held, where youth were highly encouraged to attend. Summer camps were held annually, in which speakers were invited from other places to share information with campers. In 1988, the first Annual Sikh Symposium took place in collaboration with the London Sikh Society and the Hemkunt Foundation.</p>

        <h1>Sikh Cultural Centre</h1>
        <h2>Sudbury, Ontartio</h2>
        <p>What started off as a community of about fifteen families slowly grew and resulted in the creation of the Sikh Cultural Centre. The first Sikh in Sudbury was Professor Uday Singh, who taught at Laurentian University. Professor Uday Singh settled in Sudbury, a highly Caucasian dominated area, in 1962. Professor Uday Singh eventually moved to Toronto, where he selflessly taught hundreds of Sikh youth and children how to read and write Gurmukhi (the Sikh script), and read Gurbani (prayers). Weekly congregations were held at the house of Professor Singh and as the population grew, they incorporated into a not-for-profit organization.The Sikh Cultural Centre also held seminars and lectures to educate non-Sikhs and fight the battle of racism.</p>

        <h1>Sikh Cultural Society of Metropolitan Windsor</h1>
        <h2>7955 County Rd 42, Windsor, ON</h2>
        <p>The goal of the Sikh Cultural Society of Metropolitan Windsor was to create an organization that promotes interest in Sikhi, provides a place of worship and teaches Gurmukhi to future generations of Sikhs. In October of 1971, the group registered as a charity orga- nization and bought land to build a Gurduara Sahib in 1977. The Gurduara Sahib was complete in 1980, and an extension was made in 1984. The Sikh community in this area grew to 2000 by the end of 1991. Today, the Sikh community in Windsor is well-knit and continues to strive towards maintaining their core values.</p>

        <h1>Ontario Khalsa Darbar</h1>
        <h2>7080 Dixie Road, Mississauga, ON</h2>
        <p>Before the largest Gurduara in Ontario was built, congregations used to be held at the homes of different Sikhs who were a part of Mississauga’s community. Until May of 1973, Malton Public School was rented to hold reoccurring divans. In 1974, a house with 1.75 acres of land was purchased and the construction of Ontario Khalsa Darbar began. Dharam Malik, the architect of the Gurduara Sahib mapped out the building to suit the needs of a well-functioning Gurduara Sahib because today, Ontario Khalsa Darbar — also known as “Dixie Gurduara” in the Sikh community — is the largest and busiest Gurduara Sahib in Ontario.The Ontario Khalsa Darbar also played a significant role in the first annual Nagar Keertan of Downtown Toronto, which took place in 1983.</p>

        <h1>Sikh Association of Brantford</h1>
        <h2>483 Park Road, Brantford ON</h2>
        <p>A divan was held at the house of Jasbir Singh Kolhi in April of 1973 as an act of gratefulness for his new home. This is also where the Sikh Association of Brantford came to be. After the first divan, monthly divans began to take place in the homes of other members of the community. During this time, there were approximately five to six families but the population grew overtime, resulting in the rental of a school auditorium to host divans. In 1974, the group incorporated as a charitable organization and wrote it’s constitution.</p>

        <h1>Sri Guru Singh Sabha</h1>
        <h2>7280 Airport Road, Malton, Mississauga</h2>
        <p>Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Malton, widely known as “Malton Gurdu- ara Sahib” in the Sikh community, was established in February of 1974. During this time, the population of Sikhs in the Malton area of Mississauga was 15-20 families, who met weekly for prayers and discussions. As the members of the group started to increase, they approached Morning Star Public School in 1977 to inquire about rentals, but did not go through with this plan as the costs were too high. This association was often contacted by different police forces, including the RCMP, for recruitment of Sikhs into the forces. Looking at Sikh history, it is evident that Sikhs are brave and diligent, which were traits that the forces were searching for.</p>

        <h1>Golden Triangle Sikh Association</h1>
        <h2>2070 Snyder’s Road, Kitchener, ON</h2>
        <p>The Sikhs of Kitchener and Waterloo first gathered to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev Sahib Jee’s (first Sikh Guru) 500th Gurpurb, or birthday in 1969. From here on, the community worked hard to fundraise funds to buy land and construct a Gurduara Sahib. The hard work paid off when the association bought nine acres of land built a beautiful architectural and functional Gurduara Sahib, all from scratch — which was a first in Ontario as most other Gurduara Sahibs began in homes. This investment cost approximately $268 000, which is valued as a luxury during that time. The hard working community held their first divan in November of 1983 and over 1500 Sikhs from Ontario attended — including government officials such as Jean Chretien and Paul Martin.</p>

        <h1>First Nagar Keertan of Ontario</h1>
        <h2>Downtown Toronto, ON</h2>
        <p>An article in the Toronto Star dated April 17, 1983 reads the headline “Sikhs parade in joy and peace.” This marks the first Nagar Keertan, or Sikh parade, to take place in Ontario. Nearly 2000 Sikhs of Ontario participated in the first ever Nagar Keertan in celebration of Vaisakhi, or Khalsa Saajna Divas (the creation of the Khalsa), through the streets of Downtown Toronto. The article describes the scene of the parade by stating that “Five saffron-robed sword-bear- ers led the parade followed by a horse-drawn float carrying white-bearded elders who read from holy scriptures.” The four hour parade began at Jarvis Collegiate, followed along Carlton St and College St, and ended at Queen’s Park. Although the event was joyful, the article ends off with a negative connotation which depicts how Sikhs were perceived and the racism they faced.</p>
