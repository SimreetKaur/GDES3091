		<h2>READING RESPONSE #2</h2>

		<h1>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h1>
<p>In her article “The Poetry of Tools,” when Mindy Seu begins by asking the reader to “defamiliarize our tools,” she allows the user to look beyond the function of the tools we rely on everyday. She explains that “technology is a form of language” and it is important to acknowledge and learn this “language” so that we are able to use our tools in a more efficient and meaningful manner. By this, Seu is communicating that by understanding what our tools are built of, how they are made and how much they are capable of, allows us to use them to their full potential. She also mentions that “identifying the constraints of these tools can help us recognize their poetic potential.” She uses the word poem to imply that the language our tools are made of are meaningful, just like a poem, and that it is important to read between the lines to understand them better. The use of the word poem also denotes that learning about what these tools are made of allows us to reflect upon them, which then allows us to reflect upon ourselves in relation to the tool – making the interaction between a tool and a user stronger.</p>
<h1>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h1>
<p>EARLY WORKS <br>
During this time, creators of these pieces didn’t work against the constraints, but worked with them instead. Constraints faced while designing human-computer based interactions influenced the way programs were designed, which also effected how they were perceived and used. Users interact with these pieces through actions – representing stages of early Virtual-Reality. The actions taken by the user to interact with these pieces, whether the actions are intended or not, allows the user to reflect on the actions taken and their relationship the user is building with the system. For example, when this <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4Nwht22_Gg">video </a> is viewed on a mobile device, the user is able to turn the device in different directions and the video responds accordingly. Viewing this piece through Seu’s lens of poetry and by learning the language that went behind producing it, a user is able to interact with this piece more effectively because it allows the user to understand the potential of this technology.
