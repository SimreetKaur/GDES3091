		<h2>READING RESPONSE #1</h2>

		<h1>1.	What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</h1>
<p>While the goal of theorists like Lev Manovich and Don Norman was to replace the term “user” with “people”, Lialina believes that the term “user” needs to be protected since it holds many significant meanings in the technological sphere. Lialina argues that interfaces do not need to be manipulated to provide a successful “experience” to “people,” but should be designed with the user in mind from the beginning. Lialina states that “At the dawn of personal computer the user was the center of attention. The user did not develop in parallel with the computer, but prior to it.” This suggests that the user is not a product of the computer, but the computer is a product of the user. The user is the center of attention and holds most value because the user is the reason that computers were created. Furthermore, Lialina highlights that by generating a system that allows “people” to seamlessly complete their tasks, the notion of an “invisible user” forms, threatening user rights and the identity between a user and a developer.</p>
<h1>2.	What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h1>
<p>Lialina defines the ideal internet user to be a “universal user,” somebody that can accomplish all tasks without relying on specified systems that help them complete a certain task. This user would be able to figure out how to use different systems so that it benefits them most, even if the system was not intended for the anticipated task.</p>
<h1>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h1>
<p>An example of when “gaps can be filled by users” is during the process of creating a web-generated citation. Many times, the website is not able to pick up information such as the name of the publisher, or the year the content was published. To fill this gap, one manually enters the remainder of the information and uses the template of the citation taken from the website to complete it.</p>
